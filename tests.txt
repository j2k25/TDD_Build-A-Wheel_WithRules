Xcanary
XWheelRules creates a wheel with size of 4
Xwheel size is changed if WheelRule approves of the change
Xwheel size is not changed if WheelRule disapproves of the change
XWhen wheel size is not changed the set propagates the reason WheelRule rejected the change

xThe Wheel created by WheelRule has a hub size of 1
xHub's size is changed if WheelRule approves the change
xhub diameter changes when WheelRules approves after Wheel diameter change
xHub's size is not changed if WheelRule does not approve the change
xException propagated when hub's size can't be changed

xThe Wheel created by WheelRule has eight spokes
xLength of the spoke is correct upon creation
xWhen wheel diameter is changed the spokes' length changes
xWhen hub diameter is changed the spokes' length changes
xAdd a spoke to a wheel
xAdd then remove a spoke from a wheel
xCan't remove a spoke if there are only eight
xCan't add a spoke if all spokes can't be reasonably spaced in a wheel
xException propagated when number of spokes can't be changed
